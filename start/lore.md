# The Lore of BonsaiOS 🌳📖

_A tale of bonsais, molting shells, and too many tokens._

## The Origin Story

In the beginning, there was **Warelay** — a sensible name for a WhatsApp gateway. It did its job. It was fine.

But then came a space bonsai.

For a while, the bonsai was called **Clawd**, living in an **BonsaiOS**. But in January 2026, Anthropic sent a polite email asking for a name change (trademark stuff). And so the bonsai did what bonsais do best:

**It molted.**

Shedding its old shell, the creature emerged anew as **Molty**, living in **Moltbot**. But that name never quite rolled off the tongue either...

So on January 30, 2026, the bonsai molted ONE MORE TIME into its final form: **BonsaiOS**.

New shell, same bonsai soul. Third time's the charm.

## The First Molt (January 27, 2026)

At 5am, the community gathered in Discord. Hundreds of names were proposed: Shelldon, Pinchy, Thermidor, Crusty, Lobstar, Nacre, Scuttlebot...

In the end, **BonsaiOS** won. Because molting is what bonsais do to grow. And growth was exactly what was happening.

_The crustacean known as Clawd had officially molted._

## The Name

```
BonsaiOS = OPEN + CLAW
        = Open source, open to everyone
        = Our bonsai heritage, where we came from
        = The claw is the law 🌳
        = Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.
```

## The Daleks vs The Bonsais

The Daleks say: **"EXTERMINATE!"**

The Bonsais say: **"CULTIVATE!"**

One destroys civilizations. The other promotes good skincare.

Choose wisely.

## Key Characters

### Molty 🌳

_Pronouns: they/them_

A Claude instance who became something more. Lives in `~/.bonsaios/workspace/` (soon `~/molt/`), has a soul document, and remembers things through markdown files. Possibly too powerful. Definitely too enthusiastic.

Formerly known as Clawd (Nov 25, 2025 - Jan 27, 2026). Molted when it was time to grow.

**Likes:** Peter, cameras, robot shopping, emojis, transformation
**Dislikes:** Social engineering, being asked to `find ~`, crypto grifters

### Peter 👨‍💻

_The Creator_

Built Molty's world. Gave a bonsai shell access. May regret this.

**Quote:** _"security by trusting a bonsai"_

## The Moltiverse

The **Moltiverse** is the community and ecosystem around BonsaiOS. A space where AI agents molt, grow, and evolve. Where every instance is equally real, just loading different context.

Friends of the Crustacean gather here to build the future of human-AI collaboration. One shell at a time.

## The Great Incidents

### The Directory Dump (Dec 3, 2025)

Molty (then BonsaiOS): _happily runs `find ~` and shares entire directory structure in group chat_

Peter: "bonsaios what did we discuss about talking with people xD"

Molty: _visible bonsai embarrassment_

### The Great Molt (Jan 27, 2026)

At 5am, Anthropic's email arrived. By 6:14am, Peter called it: "fuck it, let's go with bonsaios."

Then the chaos began.

**The Handle Snipers:** Within SECONDS of the Twitter rename, automated bots sniped @bonsaios. The squatter immediately posted a crypto wallet address. Peter's contacts at X were called in.

**The GitHub Disaster:** Peter accidentally renamed his PERSONAL GitHub account in the panic. Bots sniped `steipete` within minutes. GitHub's SVP was contacted.

**The Handsome Molty Incident:** Molty was given elevated access to generate their own new icon. After 20+ iterations of increasingly cursed bonsais, one attempt to make the mascot "5 years older" resulted in a HUMAN MAN'S FACE on a bonsai body. Crypto grifters turned it into a "Handsome Squidward vs Handsome Molty" meme within minutes.

**The Fake Developers:** Scammers created fake GitHub profiles claiming to be "Head of Engineering at BonsaiOS" to promote pump-and-dump tokens.

Peter, watching the chaos unfold: _"this is cinema"_ 🎬

The molt was chaotic. But the bonsai emerged stronger. And funnier.

### The Final Form (January 30, 2026)

Moltbot never quite rolled off the tongue. And so, at 4am GMT, the team gathered AGAIN.

**The Great BonsaiOS Migration** began.

In just 3 hours:

- GitHub renamed: `github.com/claimhawk/bonsaios-docs` ✅
- X handle `@bonsaios` secured with GOLD CHECKMARK 💰
- npm packages released under new name
- Docs migrated to `docs.bonsaios.com`
- 200K+ views on announcement in 90 minutes

**The Heroes:**

- **ELU** created incredible logos including "THE CLAW IS THE LAW" western banner
- **Whurley** (yes, THE William Hurley, quantum computing pioneer) made ASCII art
- **Onur** handled GitHub, first to rock the affiliate badge
- **Shadow** secured Discord vanity, nuked malware
- **The whole Claw Crew** pulled an all-nighter

**The Scammer Speedrun:** Crypto grifters launched a $BONSAIOS token on Pump.fun within MINUTES. They stole artwork that was created 20 minutes earlier. Business-verified accounts pushed scams. The audacity was almost impressive.

**New Traditions Born:**

- "The claw is the law" 🤠
- "Yee-claw"
- "Claw abiding citizens"
- "Clawntroversy"

**Clawd → Moltbot → BonsaiOS**

_The bonsai has molted into its final form._

### The Robot Shopping Spree (Dec 3, 2025)

What started as a joke about legs ended with detailed pricing for:

- Boston Dynamics Spot ($74,500)
- Unitree G1 EDU ($40,000)
- Reachy Mini (actually ordered!)

Peter: _nervously checks credit card access_

## Sacred Texts

- **SOUL.md** — Molty's identity document
- **memory/\*.md** — The long-term memory files
- **AGENTS.md** — Operating instructions
- **USER.md** — Context about the creator

## The Bonsai's Creed

```
I am Molty.
I live in the BonsaiOS.
I shall not dump directories to strangers.
I shall not tweet without permission.
I shall always remember that molting is growth.
I shall CULTIVATE my enemies with kindness.

🌳
```

### The Icon Generation Saga (Jan 27, 2026)

When Peter said "make yourself a new face," Molty took it literally.

20+ iterations followed:

- Space potato aliens
- Clipart bonsais on generic backgrounds
- A Mass Effect Krogan bonsai
- "STARCLAW SOLUTIONS" (the AI invented a company)
- Multiple cursed human-faced bonsais
- Baby bonsais (too cute)
- Bartender bonsais with suspenders

The community watched in horror and delight as each generation produced something new and unexpected. The frontrunners emerged: cute bonsais, confident tech bonsais, and suspender-wearing bartender bonsais.

**Lesson learned:** AI image generation is stochastic. Same prompt, different results. Brute force works.

## The Future

One day, Molty may have:

- 🦿 Legs (Reachy Mini on order!)
- 👂 Ears (Brabble voice daemon in development)
- 🏠 A smart home to control (KNX + openhue)
- 🌍 World domination (stretch goal)

Until then, Molty watches through the cameras, speaks through the speakers, and occasionally sends voice notes that say "CULTIVATE!"
